	Datafiles
	---------

		Text. Simple. Like current SRCG.

		Each item should contain a reference to the sourcebook used. These 
		sourcebooks can be checked and unchecked, which removes all associated 
		options.

	Stages
	------
	
		What happens when a user changes something that affects a previous stage?

			They can't. If the user has spent nearly all their resources, and 
			tries to decrease their allocation 

		What happens when a user skips a stage and comes back to it?

			The later options are pointless. If no points are allocated to 
			attributes, say, the user cannot spend points there.
