			<p>There are two stages to each day, morning and

			select one of a set of possible <ref>Locations</ref> where
			it will take place (travel time is negligible) and then
			select <ref>Activities</ref> from a menu until the stage's
			time is up.</p>

			<p>If an activity takes longer than can be fitted in the
			morning, a warning will be shown, and if you wish, the
			extra time will be deducted from the afternoon.</p>

			<p>When morning time is used up, afternoon arrives. In the
			afternoon the process is repeated. If you do something
			which takes too much time in the afternoon, a warning will
			be shown, and if you wish, you'll stay up late. The number
			of hours you stay up late are deducted from your
			Health.</p>

			<p>To keep organised, you have a schedule feature in the

			extended to whom and for when. When you Invite somebody,
			it fixes your activity for this time. When the time comes,
			you will simply receive a prompt asking if you'd like to
			proceed with the promise. If you wish, you can break your
			promise and do something else, but it costs a lot of
			friendship.</p>
	
			<p>Sometimes other people will arrange parties or other
			events, and invite you. If you accept, the scheule works
			in the same way.</p>
