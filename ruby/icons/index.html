		<h1>Icons for Ruby</h1>
		<p>
			Ruby is yet to have an agreed-upon mascot, however it does
			have many images of rubies floating about its various web
			sites. Most of these are realistic looking rubies, however
			I thought a more anime style would suit Ruby better
			because it's more idealised, simple and fun and hence a
			better icon.
		</p>
		<p>
			These icons were inspired by two things: the currency in
			Zelda computer games by Nintendo of Japan (the rupee: <img
			src="rupee.jpg" alt="A rupee"/>) and the game called
			Bejeweled (particularly <a
			href="http://www.go2share.net/game/bejeweled/">the PopCap
			Games version</a>). The rupees in Zelda and the rubies in
			Bejeweled glint and glimmer and I would have liked to add
			a similar gem-like wavery glint to these (in an anime
			style) but my drawing skills didn't seem to permit it.
			Perhaps it requires animation but perhaps not. Some Ruby
			fan come artist out there can probably improve on the
			idea.
		</p>
		<p>
			These were drawn in XFig (<a
			href="ruby.fig.gz">ruby.fig.gz</a>) and then rasterized
			and cleaned up in the GIMP. The colours are from XFig's
			predefined range of reds and I know they're not terribly
			true-to-life colours - I wasn't aiming for realism here.
