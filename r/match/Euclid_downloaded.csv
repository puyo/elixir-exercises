","Produces timber suitable for structural purposes and is a useful honey species. Also grown as an ornamental plant, particularly in coastal areas close to the sea. In Western Australia Eucalyptus botryoides has escaped from plantings and become naturalised (Hussey et al., 1997), e.g. near Hamel on the sandplain south of Perth. In Victoria Carr et al. (1992) regard this species as an environmental weed posing a serious risk to heath, dry sclerophyll forest and woodland, and lowland grassland, noting it as already widespread but occurring in small populations."

","Eucalyptus woodwardii is a popular species in horticulture in low rainfall areas. It often hybridises with another commonly cultivated arid zone species, E. torquata. As a consequence seed collected from these cultivated plants often does not show true parental type when grown.

","Flowering has been recorded in March, April, May, June, July and September.Corymbia maculata is an important forest tree providing timber for heavy construction, pit props, housing, flooring, bent work, tool handles, preservative-treated poles, plywood and pulp. As it flowers in winter it is important for winter honey production and maintenance of healthy beehives. It is also widely grown as an ornamental in parks and gardens. In Western Australia C. maculata has escaped from plantings and become naturalised (Hussey et al., 1997). In Victoria, Carr et al. (1992) regard this species as an environmental weed posing a serious risk to lowland grassland and associated woodlands, and dry sclerophyll forest and woodland, noting it as widespread but occurring in small populations."
