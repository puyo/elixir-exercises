; Exercise 1.8. Newton's method for cube roots is based on the fact that if y
; is an approximation to the cube root of x, then a better approximation is
; given by the value

; ((x / y^2) + 2y) / 3

; Use this formula to implement a cube-root procedure analogous to the
; square-root procedure. (In Section 1.3.4 we will see how to implement
; Newtonâ€™s method in general as an abstraction of these square root and
; cube-root procedures.)
